especially if you have over 10G/more than 500 samples, and your fastqs are on hpc. 

1. go to https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/

2. create a new bioproject and fill in basic information
    1. 2.Project type: 
            targeted loci environmental
            sample scope: environment
    2. 3.Target:
            manure metagenome (i know... it makes no sense... but don't put anything that's not on the list in taxonomy dastabase)
    3. because we are doing batch biosample loading, don't add anything to 5.Biosample

4. submit the bioproject as it is.
