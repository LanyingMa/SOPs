# Manure or manure-fed bioreactor sample DNA extraction
Author: Fan Yang    


## Objectives   
Obtain total DNA from manure or manure-fed bioreactor samples for downstream molecular analyses, including PCR and sequencing.    
This procedure includes two parts:    
1. Subsampling     
2. DNA extraction   

## Part 1. Subsampling 

### Materials   
1. 1 ml pipetteman   
2. 1,000 µl or 1,250 µl pipette tips   
3. razor blade    
4. disposable gloves    
5. [MoBio PowerSoil htp-96 well DNA extraction kit](https://mobio.com/products/high-through-put/soil/powersoilr-htp-96-well-soil-dna-isolation-kit.html)    

### Procedures 
1. Preperation (at least 1 day before subsampling):
    1. Clean the bench top using 70% ethanol.      
    1. Prepare wide-bore tips   
        1. wear disposable gloves    
        1. take a non-barrier 1,000 µl or 1,250 µl pipette tip
        2. wipe the razor blade clean using 70% ethanol if it's covered with dust or dirt     
        3. cut the tip using the clean razor blade for an opening ~4 mm         
             + you may be able to buy these, but make sure the opening is wide enough. Else you may not able to pipette the samples through.    
        4. rebox the tips like normal pipette tips. Label it well to indicate it contains wide-bore tips.    
        5. autoclave to sterilize 
    
2. Subsampling (may take multiple days):    
    1. Clean the bench top using 70% enthanol.    
    2. Thaw your samples ahead of time.        
    3. Take a bead plate from MoBio PowerSoil htp-96 well DNA extraction kit.    
    4. Decide the right orientation of the plate (ie., A1 at the left top corner).    
        + label plate number to the side of the plate    
        + label plate number on the silicon lid as well (this will also help you to determine the silicon lid orientation)    
        + the column letters are difficult to see. I color them with marker and it works well.   
    5. Laydown a papertowel on the benchtop then lay a kim-wipe on top of it.    
        + this create a clean spot to lay your bead plate silicon lid    
    6. Carefully lift up the silicon lid from the bead plate and lay it upside down on the kim-wipe you put down in previous step.       
        + the beads are loose. If you yank the silicon lid too hard, beads are going to fly out.    
        + I usually put another kim-wipe on the upside down silicon lid so that nothing falls on it during subsampling.    
    7. Take a thawed sample, write-down the sample label and the well it is going into (e.g., A1) in your notebook.    
    8. With the wide-bore tips you prepared, pipette 250µl manure materials into well A1.   
        + be gentle and careful when pipetting. Even with wide-bore tips, the solids in manure may clog your tips and cause the manure being sucked up into the pipetteman itself.    
        + if the samples got into the pipetteman, take the pipetteman apart to clean before proceding. If not, you will be cross contaminating all of your samples.    
    9. Repeat step 7 and 8 until the entire 96 well bead plate is filled. Store the filled plate at -80ºC until extraction.    
        + because the centrifuge, it works the best if two plates were extracted at the same time.     
    10. If you need multiple days to fill one plate, put the silicon lid back on (and seal it tight) in the exact orientation.    
        + you don't want to introduce cross contamination.    
        + store the plate in -80ºC.   


## Part 2. DNA extraction    

### Materials    
1. Multi-channel pipettemen    
2. Autoclaved pipette tips and barrier pipette tips (various volumes)   
3. Disposable media trays    

### Procedures (mostly folow the kit protocol with some modifications)
